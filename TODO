- Implement unload to cleanup
- Don't add visibility: visible; by default
- Get rid of all extra and useless div in div
- Weird bug with fg_server= and server change
- Why am I putting the server list to be inside the map?
- Scale icons according to zoom level
- Optimization: pilot count should only be updated if there's an actual change.
- Expose more GMap stuff (disable panning/zoom, etc)
  
- Fix trail lines, they don't line up with all different plane icons...
- Seems to be fixed along with GMap v2: Auto zoom/pan padding mechanism doesn't work well in all cases...
